Question: Some people promote that investing in the elderly care industry can yield high returns of 8% - 36% annualized. Is this reliable?
Answer: It's not reliable. Publicly absorbing deposits from unspecified members of the public and promising high returns must obtain relevant administrative approvals from the financial regulatory department of the State Council. Otherwise, it constitutes illegal fundraising. For example, the "Aiwan System" company in the case of Cao Mouming used this as a pretext for fundraising fraud. Therefore, one should not invest blindly just because of high returns.
Question: A company claims that investing in their elderly care project can not only make money but also enjoy elderly care services. Is this true?
Answer: Not necessarily. In the case of Dai Mouping, they carried out illegal fundraising in the name of "high - return investment + preferential elderly care services". Most of the funds were privately misappropriated and not actually used for elderly care projects. When investing, it is necessary to examine the company's operating conditions, the authenticity of the project, and whether it has financial business licenses. Don't believe it easily.
Collection Sales
Question: A merchant promises to repurchase the collectibles at a 20% premium after one year. Can we believe it?
Answer: Be cautious. In the case of Xu Mouyan, this method was used to deceive the elderly into buying so - called collectibles for fundraising fraud. If a merchant uses the promise of premium repurchase to sell goods with the main purpose of absorbing funds, it is likely to be illegal fundraising. Be vigilant.
Question: Someone promotes that a handicraft is a rare "collectible" with huge appreciation potential and they can help with auctions. Is this true?
Answer: Most likely it's false. Xu Mouqiao and others packaged cheap handicrafts as "collectibles" and used false auction records and other means to deceive the elderly into buying. When the elderly request auctions, they set up obstacles. One should have professional knowledge when buying collectibles and not trust such promotions easily.
Traditional Chinese Medicine Diagnosis and Treatment
Question: There is a "TCM expert" seeing patients in an moxibustion hall, and they also sell high - priced Chinese patent medicines. Can we buy them?
Answer: Don't buy them easily. The moxibustion hall opened by Ye Mouya and others did not have the qualifications of a TCM medical institution, and the "expert" did not have a practicing physician's license. They sold medicines made from ordinary Chinese herbal medicines to the elderly at high prices, which is a fraud in the name of TCM diagnosis and treatment. Don't be deceived.
Impersonating State Functionaries
Question: Someone claims to be a staff member of the National Poverty Alleviation Office and says they can help handle the "elderly care pension" but need to collect material fees first. Should we give the money?
Answer: Don't give the money. Xia Mou and others impersonated state functionaries and collected fees under false pretexts such as handling the "elderly care pension" for fraud. State functionaries will not charge fees in this way. When encountering such situations, verify the other party's identity and call the police if necessary.
Elderly Care Service Reservation
Question: An elderly care apartment says that paying a reservation deposit can earn an annual interest of 7% - 12% and there will be a discount for later check - in. Is this reliable?
Answer: It's not reliable. Dai Mouping and others used this method for illegal fundraising. Most of the funds were not used for the operation of the elderly care apartment, causing huge losses to the fundraising participants. The elderly care service industry cannot carry out unauthorized activities of absorbing public funds without permission. The elderly should resist such temptations and beware of being cheated.
